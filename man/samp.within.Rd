\title{Shuffles a sequence within groups defined by the input vector}
\description{Used to generate a permutation of a sequence \kbd{1:length(lev)}. observations are permutted within blocks, according to the vector \kbd{lev} passed to the function.}
\usage{
samp.within(lev)
}
\arguments{
\item{lev}{a vector containing the group to which belongs the observations to be permuted.}
}
\value{
a vector \kbd{1:length(lev)} (with blocks defined by \preformatted{lev}) randomly permuted. Usually, one passes the result to reorder observations in a data set in order to carry out permutation-based tests.
