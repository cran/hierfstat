#version 0.02

The function test.between, test.between.within and test.within now sort the data before doing the resampling. This avoids errors when the vector within, rand.unit and test.lev are not sorted. 

In function test.between and test.between.within, the vector rand.unit is transformed such that the different units are numbered consecutively

#version 0.02.2
in samp.between and samp.within, changed x<-NULL (which caused mesage Error: more elements supplied than there are to replace) into x<-list().
