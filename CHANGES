#version 0.02

The function test.between, test.between.within and test.within now sort the data before doing the resampling. This avoids errors when the vector within, rand.unit and test.lev are not sorted. 

In function test.between and test.between.within, the vector rand.unit is transformed such that the different units are numbered consecutively

#version 0.02.2
in samp.between and samp.within, changed x<-NULL (which caused mesage Error: more elements supplied than there are to replace) into x<-list().  

#version 0.03-1
in varcomp.glob, added diploid as a parameter passed to varcomp. Absence of this option caused the function to report an error message when the data were haploid
Changes were made to functions test.between, test.between.within and test.within. The vector rand.unit and test.lev are transformed such that the different units are numbered consecutively
